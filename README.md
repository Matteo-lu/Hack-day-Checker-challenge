# Hack day: Checker challenge!

This project is designed to meet the requirements of the project *Checker challenge!* as a means of consuming the holberton API.
It is a discord bot to obtain a summary of the current projects in order to have a quicker and more friendly means of consultation.

## How to use our bot

First, you have to invite the bot to your Discord server, you can use this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=893587444912492565&permissions=517544065088&scope=bot) or you can find him on the search bar, as if you were 
looking for any other user.
The bot behaves like a user, it is always listening to execute the command through a direct message or on any channel on the server. 
The command to get the summary of the ongoing projects is ```Scrap me <Holberton email> / <Holberton password>```.
